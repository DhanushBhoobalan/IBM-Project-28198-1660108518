	<h2>Learn All About Plasma</h2>
	<p  style="text-align:left;color:red;">
	<b>
	Plasma is the liquid portion of blood. About 55% of our blood is plasma, and the remaining 45% are red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets that are suspended in the plasma.
Plasma is about 92% water. It also contains 7% vital proteins such as albumin, gamma globulin and anti-hemophilic factor, and 1% mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones and vitamins.
	Plasma often is referred to as the "gift of life" because it is the essential starting material needed for therapies that help thousands of people worldwide with rare, chronic diseases to live healthier, productive and fulfilling lives.
	</b>

    <h2>What is a plasma donation?</h2>
	<p  style="text-align:left;color:red;">
	<b>In a plasma-only donation, the liquid portion of the donor’s blood is separated from the cells. Blood is drawn from one arm and sent through a high-tech machine that collects the plasma. The donor’s red blood cells and platelets are then returned to the donor along with some saline. The process is safe and only takes a few minutes longer than donating whole blood.

Donated plasma is frozen within 24 hours of being donated to preserve its valuable clotting factors. It can be stored for up to one year and thawed for transfusion to a patient when needed. Red Cross donations are often used directly for hospital patient transfusions, rather than pharmaceutical uses.

<h2>Who should donate plasma?</h2>
<p  style="text-align:left;color:red;">
<b>
The Red Cross urges people with type AB blood to consider a plasma donation. AB is the only universal plasma and can be given to patients of any blood type. This means that type AB plasma transfusions can be given immediately, without losing precious time determining if the patient’s blood type is compatible. In emergency medicine, such as caring for a major trauma or burn patient, time saved can mean the difference between life and death.
Type AB plasma donations – which the Red Cross calls “AB Elite” – can be made every 28 days, up to 13 times per year. The average donation takes one hour and 15 minutes, just a few minutes longer than donating whole blood. Schedule an appointment now.
